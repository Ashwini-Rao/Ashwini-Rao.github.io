### SUMMARY
> A skilled engineer with 2+ years of hands-on experience in **Machine Learning** and **DevOps**. Competent in supervised and unsupervised learning, predictive modeling, machine learning, probability distributions, sampling, ensembling, data extraction, and microservices. Interested in computer vision, natural language processing, graphs, networks, and AI.

### Projects

> - [__Bangalore city road traffic accidents (1980-2001)__](https://github.com/Ashwini-Rao/bangalore-city-traffic-accidents-analysis-1990-2006)
An analytics journey looking at road traffic patterns in Bangalore city during 1980-2001. The project explores exploratory analysis including data pre-processing, factor analysis, principal component analysis, clustering, and graphs. Shows some interesting insights into peak locations, accident types, and groups of vehicles involved.

> - [__Machine learning model as a web service__](https://github.com/Ashwini-Rao/ExposingModelAsAPI)
Implementation of exposing an R model as an API, we can let other applications to use model for the purposes it is designed for without having to worry about the underlying environment/architecture. You can expose plots, model metrics, scoring as APIs to consume.

> - [__VM configuration using PowerShell__](https://github.com/Ashwini-Rao/Configuring-VMs-With-Powershell)
Create multiple VMs of different OS versions from existing templates in the vSphere Web Client. It also configures the basic configurations and deploys it.

### EXPERIENCE
##### UNISYS, Bangalore — Associate Engineer
August 2016 - December 2018

**Data Science**
- Developed an intelligent **Intrusion Detection System** using a tree-based classifier (**Random Forest**) to identify unusual logins. Used **informed oversampling** to train the model for handling overfit situations. Deployed the **model as a Rest API** for classification on demand.
- **Automated data extraction** from tables in PDF files using **tabula**, data pre-processing, and creating the analytical dataset using Python. This led to directly consume data without any manual effort.

**DevOps**
- Successfully automated test cases on the web portal using **Selenium** with Java and TestNG framework, resulting in improving the overall rigor and reducing manual effort.
- Automated the VyOS router’s NAT/PAT configuration using shell scripts, thereby making it easy to set up large environments.
- Practical knowledge on weak CRL checking, creating self-signed certificates using **PowerShell, TCP/IP protocol suite, IPsec, NAT/PAT** routers and gateways.
- Worked on networking tools such as Netcat, EchoTool, iPerf  for sending/receiving TCP/UDP packets, and Wireshark, tcpdump for capturing packets and analyzing them.
